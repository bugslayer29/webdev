        GRID TEMPLATE column AND row: 

You can define how many columns and how many rows should be there in a grid.

      1. grid-template-columns:  120PX 100PX;

      which means you need first column of 120px and second column of 100px.

      2.  grid-template-row:  100PX 100PX 100px;

      which means you need first row of 100px, second row of 100px and third row of 100px.

      3. grid-row : 1/2;
     
     means grid item placed from first row to second row.

     you can also write it as 

         grid-row-start : 1;
         grid-row-end : 2;

         and same for column.



         GRID TEMPLATE AREA :


another method to create rows and columns in grid.
                            col-1       col-2      col-3
  grid-template-areas: row1- "nav       nav        nav"
                       row2- "side      article    article"
                       row3- "footer    footer     footer"
                       rpw4- "left-foot right-foot right-foot";

to target grid-rows/column for your items, you can use syntax in your itmes like
