flexbox properties :  

    To make container a flex, we use display flex property.
    

  1.Flex Direction :
It defines in which direction the flex elements would be displayed. It takes values like row, column or “reverse” too.

 2. Flex Wrap :
By using this property we can make our elements responsive for different screen sizes. 
       
       .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
            background-color: yellowgreen;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }
