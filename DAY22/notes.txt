UNITS :
    1. PIXEL : 1/96th of an inch
            since, display size is not same for everybody so we use responsive units like vw.
            IF YOU USE UNITS LIKE VW, YOUR WEBSITE WILL BE RESPONSIVE.

    2. vw :  width for viewport

    3. vh :  height for  viewport

    4. em : element multiple (jina element ko milne wala tha uska [em value] times)

    5. rem : root element multiple (jina root element ko milne wala tha uska [rem value] times )

    6. vmin :   
              vmin stands for viewport minimum. The vmin function is used to set the size of an element as a percentage of the minimum value between the viewport width or height. For example, if the viewport is 1000px wide and 800px high, if we set the width of an element to 30vmin , it will be 30% of the height.

    7.vmax : 
             vmax stands for viewport maximum. The vmax function ranks elements as a percentage of the maximum value between the viewport width or height. For example, as shown above, an element of 30vmax would be 30% of the width, or 300px .



   NOTE : Difference between Vmax and Vmin?
For example if you were on a phone that is 300px wide and 800px tall, vmin would represent the width of the viewport and vmax would represent the height of the device.
