       BOX-SHADOW is a popular CSS property that enables designers to add shadow effects around an element's frame. It can be used to give any element, be it a div, image, or button, a 3D feel or to emphasize on hover.

   for example :
      .box 
      {
        box-shadow: 5px         5px        15px   5px       #888888;  
        box-shadow: h-offset    v-offset   blur   spread    color ; [inset(inside the box)/outset(outside the box)];
      }    


TEXT-SHADOW : h-offset v-offset blur color;
              .text-element

               { 
                    text-shadow:   2px       2px       4px     #888888; 
                                   h-offset  v-offset  blur    color;
               }

          Text-shadow is utilized to give shadows specifically to the text. It can elevate the readability of the text or give it an elegant appearance.
