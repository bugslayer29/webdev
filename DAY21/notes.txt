 SPECIFITY:
    SPECIFICITY means what decides which property will be apply and in what order

    RULES FOR SPECIFICITY :

   1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear

   2.Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match(kon sa css selector phle lgega aur result dega)

   3.Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS

  4.Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type


       The order of specificity is:

Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector


      To calculate the specificity, assign the value to part of the selector:

1.Universal selector = 0
2.Element selector/ pseodo Element = 1
3.Class selector, Attribute selector, and pseodo selector = 10
4.ID selector = 100
5.INLINE style = 1000

To calculate specificity of complex selector:
for example,

h1.yellow
{
  color:yellow;
}
specificity will be= h1(specificity is 1) + yellow(specificity is 10) = 1+10 = 11
since it has more specificity than any others,so color will be yellow.

a.classes.rohit-class[href]:hover
{
  color: blue;
}
Specificity  will be= a(specificity=1/element selector)+classes(specificity=10/class selector)+rohit-class(specificity=10/class selector)+[href](specificity=10/Attribute selector)+:hover(specificity=10/pseodo selector)
= 1+10+10+10+10 = 41.


note:

when you add !important, then specificity will be 10000. That contains more specificity than any others.
